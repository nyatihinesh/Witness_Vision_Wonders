## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to **Witness Vision Wonders (WvW)**, a multi-functional application I built as a high school student (11th grade) passionate about computer vision and Python. This project integrates real-time hand tracking with OpenCV, GUI development with Tkinter, and hardware interaction via Arduino, showcasing my ability to create engaging, user-centric tech solutions. From gesture-controlled Ping-Pong to a virtual painter and educational quizzes, WvW is a testament to my skills in coding, problem-solving, and innovation.

### Key Features
- **Ping-Pong**: Play a classic game using your hands as paddles, powered by hand tracking.
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: Challenge an AI with gesture recognition.
- **Virtual Painter**: Draw in the air with color selection via hand gestures.
- **Volume Gesture Control**: Adjust system volume with thumb-index distance.
- **Press Game**: Test reflexes by pressing virtual buttons with hand proximity.
- **Air Quiz**: Answer multiple-choice questions with hand gestures.
- **Personalized Greeting**: Enter your name and get a time-based audio welcome.
